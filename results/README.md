# Low frequency noise
LFnoise measurements from Feb 2023 were made with a 0.1 ... 10 Hz noise preamp with x10000 gain. This is not accounted for in the oscilloscopes displayed values. Here's a frequency response analaysis of the preamp: https://github.com/RPG-Engineering/RSscope_scripts/blob/main/csv/euler_LNA_fra.ipynb

# ADR1000 theoretical noise
0.9 µVpp datasheet spec x 1.5 10V buffer gain x 10000 preamp gain
= 13.6 mVpp


# LTZ1000 theoretical noise
1.2 µVpp datasheet spec x 1.4 10V buffer gain x 10000 preamp gain
= 16.8 mVpp
